## Improvements/Trade-offs

As a future improvement, I think we could move the pagination and sorting logic to the backend to take some load off of the client, which would be helpful in case we have large collections of data. Also it would be nice to have the ability to remove sort direction to restore the default data ordering. At last I think we could improve UX by displaying some more information to the user like the total number of pages/entries and the ability to customize the amount of rows on each page.
A trade-off I hade to make in order to meet the deadline was responsive design. For further improvement, I'd pay closer attention to responsiveness, specially on mobile phones.
